# fort_collins_openstreetmap
Parse and clean public XML map data, then insert it into SQLite


Files:

fort_collins.osm is the entire xml file for fort collins, colorado open street MAP_SAMPLE
fc_sample.osm is generated by taking every 25th value from fort_collins.osm using make_sample_osm

the .csv files are inserted directly into sql tables



Pipeline Sequence:

Auditing:

Calling audit runs and prints specified key values from the xml document. These values needing correction
need to be inserted into CleanValue (in clean_class) variables:
expected values if they are correct, otherwise mapping or manual_changes
in order to make the necessary changes.

Parsing/Cleaning:

sql_builder calls make_csv to create the csvs to insert into tables in sql.
  make_csv uses shape_data to clean the xml and coerce data values to desired types
    shape_data uses cerberus.Validator (very slow) and schema as well as clean_class to correct audited values
     = any updates from audit needs to be updated in the clean_class CleanValue

Analysis:

query_osm runs a series of queries on the newly generated database as a proof of concept and in order to analyze
the database correctness.
